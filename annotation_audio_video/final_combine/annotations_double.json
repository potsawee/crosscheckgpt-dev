The video is annotated with real-time telemetry of electrical \"current\" and \"torque\" values, records the helicopter's lift-off and ascent. The helicopter is red. It flies close to the ground from a distance towards the camera, and when it passes by the camera, the camera tracks it and it lifts up to a higher altitude. The torque and current fluctuate but increase from around 212 to around 230 and from 226 to around 246 respectively. In the last scene, the video captures the tail of the helicopter, and there is the top of a person's head with brown hair captured."
